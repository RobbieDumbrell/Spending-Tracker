## What is this?

This is a personal **Spending Tracker**, designed to be used for an individual or small company to input and track cash spends over time, against customizable budgets, whilst assigning these spends to specified merchants and categories. Built using **Ruby**, **PostgreSQL** and **Sinatra** (a Ruby web framework).

## Why is it here?

This was a week-long solo project that I completed during my 16-week CodeClan course. This project acted as a tool to consolidate my learning of Ruby, PostgreSQL and core programming principles such as **RESTful routes**, **OOP**, and **Entity Relationships**. This is my first ever end-to-end application!

## How do I use it?

Take a look and have a play around with the app as deployed on Heroku here:

Alternatively, to run the app locally, run the following command in the terminal in the project root directory:
`ruby app.rb`

## How could it be extended/improved?

- Graphical Analysis

This project was deliberately created in Ruby to consolidate learning in that area, however I would extend this project further by incorporating graphical analysis of the transactional spends - potentially using Javascript and a JS library such as Highcharts.

- Dynamic Budget and Overview selections 

The Budget and Overview sections were extensions to the MVP, and could be improved upon further as the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 are hard-coded for viewing/editing. So, to future-proof the app, it would be much better to dynamically update the available budget and overview years as they come around.
