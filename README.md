# spending_tracker-ruby_sinatra_project

## What is this?

This is a personal **Spending Tracker**, designed to be used for an individual or small company to input and track cash spends over time, against customizable budgets, whilst assigning these spends to specified merchants and categories. Built using **Ruby**, **PostgreSQL** and **Sinatra** (a Ruby web framework).

## Why is it here?

This was a week-long solo project that I completed during my 16-week CodeClan course. This project acted as a tool to consolidate my learning of Ruby, PostgreSQL and core programming principles such as **RESTful routes**, **OOP**, and **Entity Relationships**. This is my first ever end-to-end application!

## How do I use it?

Take a look and have a play around with the app as deployed on Heroku here:
https://robbie-spending-tracker.herokuapp.com/

Alternatively, to run the app locally run the following command in the terminal in the project root directory:
`ruby app.rb`
